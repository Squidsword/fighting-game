# fighting-game
Hey guys, this is a prototype fighting game I made to help myself learn JavaScript.

(play here: https://squidsword.github.io/fighting-game/)
(fighter sprites by LuizMelo)

I'm too lazy to flip each sprite frame manually so if you're facing left the sprite animation will play in reverse
